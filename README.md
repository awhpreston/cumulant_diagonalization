# Cumulant Diagonalization

This is a project to construct nonlinear algorithms that extract 
statistically independent degrees of freedom from data.

## Datasets

### NIST Handprinted Forms and Characters Database 

A very large (985.4MB) 
[dataset](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19) 
of handwritten letters and numbers, sorted by class.

### DOW Jones dataset

A time series (89.1kB)
[dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dow+Jones+Index) 
of stock prices.

Authors' description:

This dataset contains weekly data for the Dow Jones Industrial Index. 
It has been used in computational investing research.
	

### Swarm Behaviour Data Set

A large (725.1MB)
[dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Swarm+Behaviour).

Authors' description:

This dataset achieved from an online survey, which is run by UNSW, 
Australia. It contains three data of ' Flocking - Not Flocking', 
'Aligned - Not Aligned', and 'Grouped - Not Grouped'.

The attributes are xm, ym as the (X,Y) position of each boid, xVeln, 
yVeln as the velocity vector, xAm, yAm as the alignment vector, xSm, 
ySm as the separation vector, xCm, yCm as the cohesion vector, 
 as the number of boids in the radius of Alignment/Cohesion, and 
  as the number of boids in the radius of Separation. 
  These attributes are repeated for all m boids, where m=1,...,200. 
  Also, class labels are binary, which 1 refers to flocking, grouped, 
  and aligned, and 0 refers to not flocking, not grouped, and not aligned.
